        WELCOME TO MY PROJECT EULER WEB APP
    </div>

    <div class="overlay-text">
        <a href="https://projecteuler.net/" target="_blank">Project Euler</a> is hundreds of increasingly difficult
        mathematical problems intended to be solved with computer programs. I used Scala, AWS, and Websockets to turn my
        Project Euler solutions into a reactive, multi-user web app.
    </div>


    <div class="overlay-title">
        WHAT ARE ALL THESE BUTTONS?
    </div>

    <div class="overlay-text">
        Each grey button represents one Project Euler problem. Push it to solve the problem on the server
        (or on AWS Lambda). The button turns orange while the solution is in progress. Once solved, the button turns
        green and the answer is displayed below the button. Also below each button you'll find a link to the problem
        on the official Project Euler website.
    </div>


    <div class="overlay-title">
        WHAT'S WITH THE GAUGES AND THE MAP?
    </div>

    <div class="overlay-text">
        The two gauges represent the state of the server. The left gauge shows the server's Java Virtual Machine
        (JVM) memory utilization. It can reach 100% for more demanding problems. The right gauge shows server's
        responsiveness. It should be at or near 100% until the server becomes overloaded with problems.
    </div>

    <div class="overlay-text">
        The map lets you see what the other users of this app are up to. Whenever a user
        opens this web app or solves a problem, that event is instantly broadcast to all other users.
    </div>

    <div class="overlay-text">
        Both the gauges and the map are updated in real-time via a reactive Websocket connection
        that serves as a real-time "push" notification service from the backend to all users.
    </div>

    <div class="overlay-text">
        Try opening this page in two different browsers side by side (different tabs or windows of the same browser
        will work too, though you won't get quite the same experience). Now quickly click a bunch of problem buttons.
        You'll see gauges in both browsers move in sync as they receive the same stream of data from the server.
        And as the problems you clicked are solved, you'll see solutions broadcast to both the browsers.
    </div>


    <div class="overlay-title">
        WHAT IS THE TECHNOLOGY STACK FOR THIS WEB APP?
    </div>

    <div class="overlay-text">
        The backend is written in Scala using Play framework and Akka. It runs inside a Docker container managed by the
        EC2 Container Service (ECS) on a single AWS "micro" instance (1 CPU core and 1GB of RAM). AWS Lambda is used
        to solve more computationally demanding problems -- those answers will have a "<b>(Î»)</b>" after them.
        The front-end is HTML with CSS and jQuery. It uses Ajax to request problems to be solved and
        Websockets to receive newly available solutions, user login notifications, and system status from the backend.

        WHERE IS THE SOURCE CODE?

    <div class="overlay-title">
        WHY DOES IT TAKE SO LONG TO SOLVE SOME PROBLEMS?
    </div>

    <div class="overlay-text">
        Project Euler is hard :) Many of my Project Euler solutions are very memory- and CPU-intensive, especially for
        the higher-numbered problems. AWS Lambda is used to solve the most demanding problems, but even Lambda's
        generous max of 1.5GB of memory is sometimes not enough. The vast majority of problems are solved locally on
        the AWS "micro" instance server, which can become unresponsive when overloaded. Eventually it will either finally
        solve the pending problems or run out of memory, crash, and be auto-restarted by ECS. The front-end
        re-establishes the Websocket connection after such server restarts.
