        Welcome to my Project Euler solution page.
    </span>

    <span>
        <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> is hundreds of increasingly difficult
        mathematical problems intended to be solved with computer programs.
        I enjoy solving Project Euler in <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>.
    </span>

    <span>
        This page is a web front-end to my solutions to many of Project Euler Problems.
    </span>

    <span>
        This page's backend is in <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> using
        <a href="https://www.playframework.com/">Play Framework</a> and <a href="https://akka.io/">Akka</a> actors.
        It is deployed in a <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> container
        running on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/">Amazon EC2 Container Service (ECS)</a> which
        is part of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon AWS</a>.
    </span>

    <span>
        This page itself is HTML with CSS and Javascript and jQuery. It uses Ajax to retrieve problem solutions and
        Websockets to receive a continuous stream of system status updates from the backend.
    </span>

    <span>
        Each of the numbered buttons you see on the right hand of the screen is linked to a corresponding Project Euler
        problem. There is a link to the problem below and to the right of the button.
        Clicking a button assigns one of the backend's Akka actors to solving that problem. The button turns
        red while solution is in progress and a timer below and to the left of the button counts seconds till the answer
        is received. When the solution is received the button turns blue and the answer is displayed below it.
    </span>

    <span>
        The two gauges on the left represent the continuously updated state of the backend.
    </span>

    <span>
        The top gauge shows the percent of all available memory that's being utilized
        in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) within which the Scala backend runs. This information is streamed from the
        backend to the front-end via a Websocket connection.
    </span>

    <span>
        The bottom gauge shows the responsiveness of the backend, even as it's solving many Project Euler problems
        simultaneously. The front end expects to receive status updates from the backend every second. That corresponds
        to 100% responsiveness. If that expectation is not met, the responsiveness gauge will decline from the full 100%.
    </span>

    <span>
        Many of Project Euler problems are extremely memory- and CPU-intensive, especially the higher-numbered ones.
        The backend runs on a single AWS "micro" instance with a single virtual CPU and just one gigabyte of RAM.
        It is not hard to overwhelm the backend by simultaneously starting the solutions for many higher-numbered
        problems by clicking on corresponding buttons. In those cases the backend will eventually run out of memory and
        "crash" and its container will then be automatically restarted by ECS.
        But there may be a lengthy period of unresponsiveness before that happens. Please click responsibly!
