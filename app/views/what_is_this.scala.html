        WELCOME TO MY PROJECT EULER WEB APP
    </div>

    <div class="overlay-text">
        <a href="https://projecteuler.net/" target="_blank">Project Euler</a> is hundreds of increasingly difficult
        mathematical problems intended to be solved with computer programs.
    </div>


    <div class="overlay-title">
        WHAT ARE ALL THESE BUTTONS?
    </div>

    <div class="overlay-text">
        Each grey button represents one Project Euler problem. Push it to solve the problem on the server
        (or on AWS Lambda). The button turns orange while the solution is in progress. Once solved, the button turns
        green and the answer is displayed. Below the button is a link to the problem statement on Project Euler website.
    </div>


    <div class="overlay-title">
        WHAT'S WITH THE GAUGES AND THE MAP?
    </div>

    <div class="overlay-text">
        The two gauges represent the state of the server.
        The left gauge shows the server's Java Virtual Machine (JVM) memory utilization. It can reach 100% for
        more demanding problems. The right gauge shows server's responsiveness. It should be near or at 100%
        until the server becomes overloaded.
    </div>

    <div class="overlay-text">
        The map lets you see what the other users of this app are up to. Whenever a new user
        opens the web app or solves a problem, that event is instantly broadcast to all other users.
    </div>

    <div class="overlay-text">
        Both the gauges and the map are updated in real-time from the server via a Websocket connection.
        Try opening this page in different browser windows side by side (different browsers work better for this demo
        than different tabs of the same browser since tabs share cookies). Now quickly click several problem buttons.
        You'll see gauges in both browsers move in sync as they receive the same stream of data from the server.
        And as the problems you clicked are solved, you'll see solutions broadcast to both the browser windows.
    </div>


    <div class="overlay-title">
        WHAT IS THE TECHNOLOGY STACK FOR THIS WEB APP?
    </div>

    <div class="overlay-text">
        The backend is written in Scala using Play framework and Akka. It runs inside a Docker container managed by the
        EC2 Container Service (ECS) on a single AWS "micro" instance (1 CPU core and 1GB of RAM). AWS Lambda is used
        to solve more computationally demanding problems -- those answers have "(Î»)" after them.
        The front-end is HTML with CSS and jQuery. It uses Ajax to request problems to be solved and
        Websockets to receive newly available solutions, user login notifications, and system status from the backend.
    </div>


    <div class="overlay-title">
        WHERE IS THE SOURCE CODE?
    </div>

    <div class="overlay-text">
        The repos for my Project Euler solutions and for this web app are on GitHub:
        <a href="https://github.com/msokoryansky2/ProjectEuler" target="_blank">here</a> and
        <a href="https://github.com/msokoryansky2/project-euler-web" target="_blank">here</a> respectively.
    </div>


    <div class="overlay-title">
        WHY DOES IT TAKE SO LONG TO SOLVE SOME PROBLEMS?
    </div>

    <div class="overlay-text">
        Project Euler is hard :) Many of my Project Euler solutions are very memory- and CPU-intensive, especially for
        the higher-numbered problems. AWS Lambda is used to solve the most demanding problems. The backend can become
        unresponsive if it's overloaded. Eventually it will either finally solve the pending problems or run out of memory,
        crash, and be auto-restarted by ECS.
