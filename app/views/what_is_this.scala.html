        WELCOME TO MY PROJECT EULER WEB APP
    </div>

    <div class="overlay-text">
        <a href="https://projecteuler.net/" target="_blank">Project Euler</a> is hundreds of increasingly difficult
        mathematical problems intended to be solved with computer programs.
    </div>


    <div class="overlay-title">
        WHAT ARE ALL THESE BUTTONS?
    </div>

    <div class="overlay-text">
        Each grey button corresponds to one Project Euler problem. The button turns orange while the solution
        is in progress and then green once it's solved. The answer is displayed below the button. Below and to the right
        of the button is a link to the problem description on Project Euler website.
    </div>


    <div class="overlay-title">
        WHAT DO THE GAUGES MEAN?
    </div>

    <div class="overlay-text">
        The two gauges on the left represent the state of this web app's backend.
        They are updated continuously via a Websocket connection.
    </div>

    <div class="overlay-text">
        The top gauge shows the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) memory utilization (relative to max available to the JVM).
        It should be close to 0% when there is plenty of free memory but can quickly approach 100% for more demanding
        problems.
    </div>

    <div class="overlay-text">
        The bottom gauge shows the general responsiveness of the backend. It will stay at 100% until the backend becomes
        overloaded with problems, especially if those problems also push memory utilization close to 100%.
    </div>

    <div class="overlay-text">
        Try opening this page in different browser windows and clicking a few of the problem buttons.
        You'll see gauges in both browsers move in sync as they receive the same status data from their common backend.
    </div>


    <div class="overlay-title">
        WHY IS THERE A MAP?
    </div>

    <div class="overlay-text">
        This web app allows different users "share" their solutions. If one user solves a problem, the answer is
        instantly broadcast to all other users as well. The corresponding problem button will turn green on all their
        screens, under the button there will be a note about where the solution took place, and the map will pan over
        to the location of the solver. In addition, the map will pan to the locations of newly connected users.
    </div>

    <div class="overlay-text">
        You can open the app up in two different browsers (tabs of the same browser share cookies, so you don't get the
        same effect) to get a feel for user experience with multiple simultaneous users.
    </div>



    <div class="overlay-title">
        WHAT IS THE TECHNOLOGY STACK FOR THIS WEB APP?
    </div>

    <div class="overlay-text">
        The backend is written in Scala using Play framework and Akka. It runs on a single AWS "micro" instance
        (1 virtual CPU and 1GB of RAM), inside a Docker container managed by the EC2 Container Service (ECS).
    </div>

    <div class="overlay-text">
        The front-end is HTML with CSS and jQuery. It uses Ajax to request problems to be solved and
        Websockets to broadcast newly available solutions, user login events, and system status from the backend.
    </div>



    <div class="overlay-title">
        WHERE IS THE SOURCE CODE?
    </div>

    <div class="overlay-text">
        The repos for my Project Euler solutions and for this web app are on GitHub:
        <a href="https://github.com/msokoryansky2/ProjectEuler" target="_blank">here</a> and
        <a href="https://github.com/msokoryansky2/project-euler-web" target="_blank">here</a> respectively.
    </div>



    <div class="overlay-title">
        WHY IS IT SO SLOW?
    </div>

    <div class="overlay-text">
        Project Euler is hard :) Many of my Project Euler solutions are very memory- and CPU-intensive, especially for
        the higher-numbered problems. Several of the problems can individually overwhelm the backend.
    </div>

    <div class="overlay-text">
        The backend can become unresponsive as it's solving some of the more resource-intensive problems.
        It eventually recovers -- either via finally solving the pending problems or by running out of memory,
        crashing, and being auto-restarted by ECS.
    </div>

    <div class="overlay-text">
        I may explore shifting the solution logic to AWS Lambda which should solve the responsiveness issue.
        Of course, beefing up the hardware would solve it as well.
    </div>
