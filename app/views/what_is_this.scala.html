        Welcome to my  <a href="https://projecteuler.net/" target="_blank">Project Euler</a> solutions web app!
        Project Euler is hundreds of increasingly difficult mathematical problems to to be solved with computer programs.
    </div>

    <div class="overlay-text">
        The source code to both my Project Euler solutions and this web app itself are on GitHub
        <a href="https://github.com/msokoryansky2/ProjectEuler" target="_blank">here</a> and
        <a href="https://github.com/msokoryansky2/project-euler-web" target="_blank">here</a>.

    <div class="overlay-text">
        This web app's backend is written in Scala using Play framework and Akka.
        The backend runs inside a Docker container on Amazon EC2 Container Service (ECS), part of Amazon AWS.
    </div>

    <div class="overlay-text">
        The front-end is HTML with CSS and Javascript and jQuery. It uses Ajax to retrieve problem solutions and
        Websockets to receive a continuous stream of system status updates from the backend.
    </div>

    <div class="overlay-text">
        Each of the numbered buttons you see on the right hand of the screen is linked to a corresponding Project Euler
        problem. There is a link to the problem's Project Euler page below and to the right of the button.
    </div>

    <div class="overlay-text">
        Clicking a button assigns one of the backend's Akka actors to solving that problem. The button turns
        red while solution is in progress. A timer below and to the left of the button counts seconds until the answer
        is received. When the solution is received the button turns blue and the answer is displayed below it.
    </div>

    <div class="overlay-text">
        The two gauges on the left represent the continuously streamed state of the backend.
        The streaming is done over a Websocket connection.
    </div>

    <div class="overlay-text">
        You can verify that the gauges are driven by the backend data by opening this page in two or more browser windows.
        You'll see gauges in both browsers move in sync as they receive the same status data from the common backend.
    </div>

    <div class="overlay-text">
        The top gauge shows the percent of all available memory that's being utilized inside the Java Virtual Machine
        (JVM) within which the Scala backend runs.
    </div>

    <div class="overlay-text">
        The bottom gauge shows the responsiveness of the backend.
        The front end expects to receive status updates from the backend every second. That corresponds
        to 100% responsiveness. If that expectation is not met because the backend is busy solving problems,
        the responsiveness gauge will decline from the full 100%.
    </div>

    <div class="overlay-text">
        Many of Project Euler problems are very memory- and CPU-intensive, especially the higher-numbered ones.
        The backend runs on one AWS "micro" instance with a single virtual CPU and 1GB of RAM.
        It is not hard to overwhelm the backend by simultaneously starting the solutions for many higher-numbered
        problems by clicking on corresponding buttons. In those cases the backend will eventually run out of memory and
        "crash" and its container will then be automatically restarted by ECS.
        But there may be a lengthy period of unresponsiveness before that happens.
